" use this colorscheme or integrate it into an existing colorscheme
colorscheme org_dark

" It is (or will be) helpful to see eol characters when using
" VimOrganizer, since lines ending with a space are treated
" as having soft returns, lines ending with non-space have 
" hard returns
set list
set listchars=tab:�\ ,eol:�
" guioption -L removes left scrollbar, which is especially 
" irritating when split vertical windows appear in VimOrganizer
set guioptions-=L
" g:org_agenda_dirs specify directories that, along with 
" their subtrees, are searched for list of .org files when
" accessing EditAgendaFiles().  Specify your own here, otherwise
" default will be for g:org_agenda_dirs to hold single
" directory which is directory of the first .org file opened
" in current Vim instance:
" Below is line I use in my Windows install:
"let g:org_agenda_dirs=["c:/users/herbert/documents/my\ dropbox","c:/users/herbert/desktop"]

" vars below are used to define default Todo list and
" default Tag list.  Will be changed in near future so
" that these are defined by config lines in each .org
" file itself, but now these are where you can change things:
let g:org_todo_setup='TODO | DONE'
" while g:org_tag_setup is itself a string
let g:org_tag_setup='{@home(h) @work(w) @tennisclub(t)} \n {easy(e) hard(d)} \n {computer(c) phone(p)}'

" leave these as is:
au! BufRead,BufWrite,BufWritePost,BufNewFile *.org 
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.org            call org#SetOrgFileType()
au BufRead *.org :PreLoadTags
au BufWrite *.org :PreWriteTags
au BufWritePost *.org :PostWriteTags

" below are two examples of Org-mode "hook" functions
" These present opportunities for end-user customization
" of how VimOrganizer works.  For more info see the 
" documentation for hooks in Emacs' Org-mode documentation:
" http://orgmode.org/worg/org-configs/org-hooks.php#sec-1_40

" These two hooks are currently the only ones enabled in 
" the VimOrganizer codebase, but they are easy to add so if
" there's a particular hook you want go ahead and request it
" or look for where these hooks are implemented in 
" /ftplugin/org.vim and use them as example for placing your
" own hooks in VimOrganizer:
function! Org_property_changed_functions(line,key, val)
        "call confirm("prop changed: ".a:line."--key:".a:key." val:".a:val)
endfunction
function! Org_after_todo_state_change_hook(line,state1, state2)
        "call ConfirmDrawer("LOGBOOK")
        "let str = ": - State: " . Pad(a:state2,10) . "   from: " . Pad(a:state1,10) .
        "            \ '    [' . Timestamp() . ']'
        "call append(line("."), repeat(' ',len(matchstr(getline(line(".")),'^\s*'))) . str)
        
endfunction
